German Credit Risk Analysis

About the Project
This project analyzes credit risk patterns using the German Credit Dataset from UC Irvine (originally curated by Hans Hofmann). It explores relationships between categorical attributes and creditworthiness, categorizes clients as "good" or "bad" based on credit risk, calculates the average credit amount by job type, and investigates credit risk distribution based on loan duration.

The project is focused on:

Understanding credit risk trends

Segmenting clients by risk

Exploring key financial indicators using visual analytics

Built With:

Python (Data analysis & transformation)

SQL-style queries (via Python equivalents like pandas)

Power BI (Data visualization & dashboard creation)

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Power BI Desktop

Excel (for basic data formatting)

 Installation

 Ensure you have the dataset and required Python libraries downloaded. Set up your environment with the necessary tools to begin the analysis and visualization process.

Usage

This project is intended to help:

Understand and segment clients based on credit risk

Analyze the average credit amount by job type

Visualize how credit risk is distributed across different loan durations

Explore interactive dashboards to gain business insights

Roadmap

Download the dataset from the UC Irvine repository

Perform initial formatting and alignment in Excel

Load and clean the data using Python

Convert numerical codes to human-readable labels

Conduct exploratory data analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

Save the cleaned dataset for further use

Import the dataset into Power BI

Build interactive dashboards and use DAX to create calculated columns

Future enhancement: add predictive modeling and advanced analytics
